            <h4>Rusty Myers</h4>
            <h4>Professor of Environmental Science</h4>
            <h4>Alaska Pacific University</h4>
            <img src= "http://www.chemistswithoutborders.org/images/bios/rusty_sm.jpg"/><p>Rusty Myers was Professor of Environmental Science at Alaska Pacific University where he had taught for 35 years. He had a B.Sc. in chemical engineering and holds two Master’s degrees one in physical oceanography and one in environmental engineering from the University of Alaska. He received his Ph.D. from Florida Institute of Technology in science education. His primary teaching duties at Alaska Pacific University involved teaching chemistry and meteorology. Rusty had garnered a number of awards during his teaching career including APU Merit Award for Teaching (1987, 2000), APU President’s Forum Award for Outstanding Teaching (1992, 2008), APU Merit Award for Outstanding Online Instruction (2006), Exemplary Teaching Award, General Board of Higher Education United Methodist Church (1994), and Alaska Professor of the Year (1994).</p>
            <p>His professional interests were varied, but had focus on urban environmental issues, science education, and science and the humanities. He had authored 15 articles in journals, numerous reviews, and several books. Early in his career his research focused primarily on air quality. After completing several studies on wood burning impacts on ambient air quality using receptor modeling, he turned his attention to indoor air pollution focusing on indoor air pollutants, and sick building syndrome. Over the last twenty years Rusty had devoted much of his research interests to water quality in urban environments. During this time he had worked with citizen monitoring groups on Anchorage streams and stream rehabilitation. In addition to his teaching and research he had authored three reference books: two in chemistry and one in physics. The most recent is The 100 Most Important Chemical Compounds: A Reference Guide by Greenwood Press (2007). He was directing Chemists Without Borders Lois Ongley Sierra Leone Project.</p>
            <p>Outside of work Rusty liked to spend time with his wife Chris enjoying the Alaskan outdoors, athletics and traveling.</p>

            <h4>Distinguished Member</h4>
            <img src= "http://www.chemistswithoutborders.org/images/bios/lois_sm.jpg" /><p>In 2011, the Executive Committee of Chemists Without Borders awarded Professor Lois Katherine Ongley of Unity College, Maine, the Distinguished Member of Chemists Without Borders Award for her dedication and accomplishments for the organization. Lois joined the ranks of only two other Distinguished Members, Nazneen Khanam and K. C. Wang. Lois brought broad knowledge and expertise, not just in technical and scientific areas, but also in the development of an organization like ours. She was a major player in both our arsenic remediation and green chemistry education efforts. Her passion for teaching and for making a difference took her half way around the world and back on our behalf. Lois also served as Corporate Secretary of Chemists Without Borders, and with her dedication, patience and initiative, she made a massive contribution to our growth and development. The mission and vision of Chemists Without Borders which Lois helped create and implement persists, and the Sierra Leone "chemistry-in-a-baggie" education project will be officially named the Lois K. Ongley Chemistry Kits for Sierra Leone Project, colloquially referred to as “Lois Labs”. Sadly, Dr. Ongley died of cancer on November 16th, 2013. Lois was a person whom we are most happy and honored to call our friend. She will be greatly missed.</p>
