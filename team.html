                <h4>Rolande R. Hodel</h4>
                <h4>Director, Executive Team</h4>
                <p>Ph.D. in Organic Chemistry, CUNY, Queens College, New York; M.S. in Inorganic Chemistry, U. of Kansas, Lawrence Kansas. Previously worked as research scientist in the pharmaceutical industry focused on drug delivery, specifically insulin. Presently adjunct professor at Westchester Community College, Valhalla NY since 2009.</p>               
                <p>But the love of my life is that as founder and president of AIDSfreeAFRICA. AIDSfreeAFRICA’s mission it is to empower people in Africa to manufacture pharmaceuticals locally, to implement supply chains supporting access to pharmaceuticals and diagnostics, and to bring STEM education in Africa to the level of the 21 century. For 10 years we have supported Cameroonians and now we have started to build our own laboratory with the purpose to offer services in quality control of pharmaceutical drugs and water.</p>
                <p>For this work I have received three humanitarian awards so far, namely the US Astellas Foundation Humanitarian Award endowed with $30,000 honoring a scientist who makes a difference in the lives of people in developing countries, administered by ACS in 2009; the Rotary Jersey City, NJ, Legacy of Service Award for International Service 2015; and Harvard Law School “Getting to Zero” award in recognition of World AIDS Day, 2012. A submission of the design of organization of AIDSfreeAFRICA to the Buckminster Fuller Design Challenge, came in as one of the finalists in 2009.</p>
                <p>I have been on the board of directors of Chemists Without Borders since the beginning. My contribution to this organization lies in my years of experience managing a non-profit organization as well as my experience working in a developing country. I do spend 3 month every year in Cameroon and have done so for the past 10 years. The work with Chemists Without Borders has been mutually beneficial, as it is supposed to be. Public relations are important and having Chemists Without Borders spreading the word on AIDSfreeAFRICA and vice versa makes sense especially since both organizations have the love for Chemistry at the core of their existence.</p>
