            <span id="missionVision">
                <p>Here at Chemists Without Borders we solve humanitarian problems by mobilizing the resources and expertise of the global chemistry community and its networks.</p>
                <p>Chemists Without Borders was founded by Bego Gerber and Steve Chambreau in response to the article "Carbohydrate Vaccines" that was published in Chemical & Engineering News on August 9, 2004. Bego was appalled that there was an outstanding vaccine against typhoid fever sitting on the shelf not being utilized while over 10 million people around the World are infected with this terrible disease. Especially with the mortality rate for untreated typhoid being 12-30%. This prompted a letter to the editor of Chemical and Engineering News in September 2004 suggesting the creation of Chemists Without Borders to bring an end to such maldistribution.</p>
                <p>In the comming years our vision is to establish a global support network of volunteers providing mentoring, information and advice to ensure every person, everywhere, has affordable, consistent and persistent access to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Essential medicines and vaccines</li>
                    
                    <li>Sufficient safe water</li>
                    
                    <li>A sustainable energy supply</li>
                    
                    <li>Education in green chemistry and business which people can apply in their daily lives and teach to others</li>
                    
                    <li>Safe processes in work environments where chemical hazards exist</li>
                    
                    <li>Emergency support, including essential supplies and technology</li>
